# AI Browser Project

This project is a modern web application built with Svelte/SvelteKit, designed to provide AI-powered functionalities for both developers and end-users. It leverages TypeScript for robust typing and Tailwind CSS with DaisyUI for a responsive and intuitive user interface.

## Scope

### For Users

This application offers a seamless experience for interacting with AI-driven features, including:

- **Image Background Removal**: Easily remove backgrounds from images with advanced AI algorithms.
- **Image Upscaling**: Enhance image resolution and quality using AI-powered upscaling techniques.

The goal is to provide accessible and efficient tools for common AI-related tasks directly within your browser.

### For Developers

This project serves as a robust foundation for building and extending AI-powered web applications. Key technologies and practices include:

- **Svelte/SvelteKit**: A modern, reactive framework for building performant web interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety and improves code maintainability.
- **Tailwind CSS & DaisyUI**: A utility-first CSS framework combined with a component library for rapid UI development and consistent styling.

- **Web Workers**: These are scripts running in the background, separate from the main execution thread of a web page. They are used for computationally intensive tasks (e.g., image processing like background removal and upscaling) to prevent the main thread from being blocked, thus maintaining a smooth and responsive user interface.

Developers can easily extend existing functionalities, integrate new AI models, and contribute to a clean, maintainable codebase. The project emphasizes a strong Developer Experience (DX) with efficient tools and clear conventions.
